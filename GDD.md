# Merlin le Roi
## Game design
### Overview
_Merlin le Roi_ is a 3D adventure dungeon crawler game, where the player 
explores a hostile dungeon, clearing it out by fighting dangerous foes using
magical spells.

The player depends on his wits, memory, and speed to get through the level alive
and defeat his enemies.

The player has many spells to choose from, with different effects and targets.
Players need to think strategically and decide what spell to use on what enemy
(i.e. fire on an ice enemy), whether to heal, or rest and regenerate mana.

The spells are drawn by the player on a grid of runes, in a manner similar to
games like "osu!". A combination of speed and precision as well as smarts is
needed to effectively fight through the dungeon.
### Plot and Setting
#### Plot introduction
In a far away and forgotten time, you, the player character, embark on an
expedition to discover the secrets of Merlin — the long-perished wizard king,
who, a long time ago, holed himself up in a now-abandoned castle on the
outskirts of the land. You have heard many rumors: Merlin has discovered the
deepest secrets of wizardry; or that he has discovered an object of such immense
power that he has been deemed a danger to us all, and thus banished… the truth,
however, far surpasses the magnitude of these rumors.

As you approach, you see that the castle is in ruins — you can see it's been
abandoned for centuries. The stones making up its walls and towers are crumbled
and in disrepair, and it seems like no one is around. However, as you explore
further, you begin to hear strange noises; the flapping of wings, thuds, and
high-pitched whines of rats. The noises seem to be coming from around the
stairway.

Near the stairway, you notice a faint light coming from the stairs down. The
sounds seem to be coming from the basement. Is this where you will finally learn
what the king has been hiding all along?
#### Setting
The game is set in a magical world with gothic, vampiric elements, akin to
the film Nosferatu. The aesthetics revolve around magic, wizardry, death,
undeath, the dark arts, and biological manipulation.

#### Spells and spellcasting
Spells are the main method of interaction with the world that the player uses.
The gameplay revolves around spells and casting them. Each spell is made out of
at least 2 different symbols. The maximum amount of symbols is 12, each for
every month and astrological sign.

The player needs to cast spells with care: a miscast results in unforseen
consequences, sometimes good, and sometimes tragic.

A large amount of spells is balanced and designed with care; however, as you go
later into the game, or decide to continue playing past the win condition,
spells become randomly generated.

Fire symbols: Aries, Leo, Saggitarius (hot, dry, ardent)
Earth symbols: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn (heavy, cold, dry)
Air symbols: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius (light, hot, wet)
Water: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces (cold, wet, soft)
