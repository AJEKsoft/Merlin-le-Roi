Merlin le Roi

Game design

### Overview

_Merlin le Roi_ is a 2D adventure dungeon crawler game, where the
player explores a hostile dungeon, clearing it out by fighting
dangerous foes using magical spells.

The game operates on a realtime, per-level basis. The player depends
on his wits, memory, and speed to get through the level alive and
defeat his enemies.

The player has many spells to choose from, with different effects and
targets. Players need to think strategically and decide what spell to
use on what enemy (i.e. fire on an ice enemy), whether to heal, or
rest and regenerate mana.

The spells are drawn by the player on a grid of runes, in a manner
similar to games like "osu!". A combination of speed and precision as
well as smarts is needed to effectively fight through the dungeon.

#### Spells and spellcasting

Spells are the main method of interaction with the world that the
player uses. The gameplay revolves around spells and casting
them. Each spell is made out of at least 2 different symbols. The
maximum amount of symbols is 12, each for every month and astrological
sign.

The player needs to cast spells with care: a miscast results in
unforseen consequences, sometimes good, and sometimes tragic.

A large amount of spells is balanced and designed with care; however,
as you go later into the game, or decide to continue playing past the
win condition, spells become randomly generated.

Fire symbols: Aries, Leo, Saggitarius (hot, dry, ardent)
Earth symbols: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn (heavy, cold, dry)
Air symbols: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius (light, hot, wet)
Water: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces (cold, wet, soft)

Development
-----------

The game engine used will be Godot4. The graphics will be created
using Inkscape and preferrably rendered in a scalable manner in the
engine. Music will be composed on analog and FM synthesizer and a drum
machine and effects. Audio will be created in that manner as well.
