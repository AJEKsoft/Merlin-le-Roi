Merlin le Roi
=============

Game design

### Overview

_Merlin le Roi_ is a 2D adventure dungeon crawler game, where the
player explores a hostile dungeon, clearing it out by fighting
dangerous foes using magical spells.

The game operates on a realtime, per-level basis. The player depends
on his wits, memory, and speed to get through the level alive and
defeat his enemies.

The player has many spells to choose from, with different effects and
targets. Players need to think strategically and decide what spell to
use on what enemy (i.e. fire on an ice enemy), whether to heal, or
rest and regenerate mana.

The spells are drawn by the player on a grid of runes, in a manner
similar to games like "osu!". A combination of speed and precision as
well as smarts is needed to effectively fight through the dungeon.
